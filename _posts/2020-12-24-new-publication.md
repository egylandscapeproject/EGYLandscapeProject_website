We are excited to announce a new publication by our team member, [Dr. Alison L. Gascoigne](https://www.egylandscape.org/members/AlisonGascoigne/), has published a new study on Tell TinnÄ«s. 
At one time a prosperous port and manufacturing center, it was abandoned in the 13th century due to raids by Crusaders.
[The Island City of Tinnis: A Postmortem](https://www.ifao.egnet.net/publications/catalogue/9782724707618/) publishes the results of archaeological work undertaken between 2004 and 2012.
